# Production Problem Statement

## Background
Modern algorithmic trading requires **real-time processing of massive datasets** with multiple technical indicators, proprietary signals, and market intelligence. Traditional single-file processors cannot handle the scale and automation demands of professional trading operations that need to process 1000+ stocks daily with zero manual intervention.

## Production Challenge
**Primary Issue**: How to build a **production-scale automated pipeline** that processes 1000+ JSON files daily/weekly, converts complex market data into TradingView-compatible format, and delivers fresh trading signals to Pine Script strategies with complete automation and monitoring.

## Scale Requirements
- **Volume**: 1000+ JSON files per processing run
- **Output**: 4000+ CSV files generated automatically  
- **Frequency**: Daily and weekly processing cycles
- **Reliability**: 99.5%+ success rate with automatic error recovery
- **Latency**: Fresh data available within 1 hour of upload
- **Automation**: Zero manual intervention from upload to trading

## Current Data Structure

  "rlst": 78,                  // Relative Strength Rating (0-99)
  "bc": 24565.35,              // Base Count Consolidation Indicator
  "pdt": "TradingDate"         // Price Data Type
}
```

### 3. Strategic Signals
```json

  "blueDotData": {
    "dates": [
      {"blueDotDate": "2024-11-11"},
      {"blueDotDate": "2024-11-08"}
    ],
    "isRSBlueDotSatisfied": 0,
    "isASM": 0,
    "isGSM": 0
  }
}
```

### 4. Market Context
